# I will put a video covering everything here

# How to install
1. Go to the side and find the release for your OS.
2. Download and follow the installer.
3. The app will then be available for use.

# Don't Read Me
Unless you want to. The remainder of this README file is just notes for myself and anyone interested in helping to know exactly how the project works and what specifications it should work to.

I will write the technical specifications later I should probably first of all make something that people can use.
